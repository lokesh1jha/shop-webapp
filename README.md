# shop-webapp
First MVC app 

1. Data of product was saved in a array
2. Then, A class was introduced with methods to create, fetch, edit, delete
3. Then, SQL is used
4. Then, Sequelize is used 

Sequelize gives smooth handling of data with node language, however it converts those codes to SQL query and executes it.
Sequelize returns as Promise,so its good to get the data first and then() executes. catch() if any error.
